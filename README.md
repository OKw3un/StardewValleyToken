Farm Automation for Stardew Valley

This project automates farming tasks in Stardew Valley by simulating keyboard and mouse inputs using the WindowsInput library. The automation includes activities such as tilling the soil, sowing seeds, and navigating the in-game map to cover a specified area (width and length). The script also ensures that the game window stays in focus and performs actions like escaping the game menu.

Features

Brings Stardew Valley to the foreground if it is not already in focus.
Simulates keyboard inputs to control player movement (left, down, up).
Uses mouse automation to simulate the use of tools (hoe) and sow seeds.
Customizable area dimensions for farming tasks (width and length).
Automatically exits the game menu by sending the ESC key press.

Requirements

Windows Operating System
WindowsInput library for simulating keyboard and mouse events
Stardew Valley installed and running

How to Use

Run the program while Stardew Valley is open.
Enter the desired width and length for the area you want to automate.
The program will bring the game to the foreground, simulate the necessary inputs, and perform farming tasks on your behalf.
