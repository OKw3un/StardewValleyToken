# StardewValleyToken
Automates farming tasks in Stardew Valley by simulating keyboard and mouse inputs. The script navigates the map, tills soil, and sows seeds based on customizable area dimensions (width and length). It also ensures the game window stays focused and exits the game menu using the ESC key.
